----
* cleanup
  * select arrow / line only when clicking close to the line, *not* on the entire bounding rectangle
  * test with Windows --> performance with accelerator engine?
  * automatically delete empty text shapes
  * text clipped for horizontal / vertical lines
  * add four missing resize handles
  * limit re-rendering of shapes during interactive 'resize' etc.
  * command (i.e. undo / redo) for selection
  * special treatment for 'select click' --> no 'move' operation - but what are good criteria?!
  * serialize update rendering per shape
    * delay re-rendering during drag: only one concurrently running re-rendering?
    * limit thread pool size for background tasks
    * queue per shape (?), remove all but the latest
    * counter --> ignore earlier bitmaps when later bitmaps are already rendered
  * height / width of a box: derive from font
  * restore window position when leaving full screen mode
  * remove 'press ESC to leave full screen mode' message
  * add tic marks to 'view' menu items
  * Boxes: strokeType.INSIDE (instead of CENTER)
* features
  * '+' / '-' moves shape forward / backward in Z Order
  * loading / saving diagrams
  * new diagram (another window)
  * dirty state of a diagram --> 'are you sure' dialog
  * delete diagram element
  * new diagram element
  * double click --> details dialog
  * grid (optional) in the background
  * Ctrl-Resize, Shift-Resize
  * Ctrl-Move, Shift-Move
  * zoom
  * line ends
    * full triangle
    * empty triangle
    * "elegant" arrow
  * dashed / dotted lines
  * lines *between* boxes --> find point of intersection between line and box
  * different line style for lines 'behind' a box (e.g. dashed)
  * 'background boxes', i.e. borders used for visually grouping stuff
* JavaFX APIs
  * FontSmoothingType
  * lighting
  * reflection
  * changed menu item text --> re-render problem?!
* application
  * tool bar, status bar
  * accordion on the left
  * tree view with the logical structure
  * arrow between two boxes / shapes
  * different scaling for screen and export
  * manual / explicit *relative* correction for visual start / end point of lines (x / y / *axial* / *distance from box*)
* thoughts
  * shadow for lines (?)
  * OVERLAP for bounding line around boxes (?)
  * sub-pixel anti-aliasing on rotated fonts


* visual test suite (render to windows and files --> potentially different rendering engine?)
  * line endings at different angles and different line widths --> 'overlap' vs 'gap'
